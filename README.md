This is my loop assignment. I imported a CSV data file with smoking-related tweets. I created a sub data frame including only the tweets that were favored and/or retweeted one time or more. 
Then I added two new columns to the dataframe with high or low values based on whether the number of likes/retweets was above or below the mean.
